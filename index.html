<h3>Building Disaster Resilience Through Experiential Learning</h3>
<p>A four-day intensive program equipping participants with climate science knowledge and response mechanisms.</p>
<p>The Amrita School for Sustainable Futures launched its first certificate course for Disaster
Risk Reduction (DRR) and capacity building, titled 'Building Disaster Resilience and Social
Responsibility Through Experiential Learning,' on April 21, 2025. This was a four-day, in
person (offline) program conducted at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapetetham’s Amritapuri campus in
Kerala.
Climate change poses an existential threat to civilization, impacting every aspect of life, from
the environment and economy to public health and security. Urgent, informed action is needed
to enhance resilience (SDG 13.1) and build capacity for climate adaptation and mitigation
(SDG 13.2). This course addressed this critical need by introducing participants,, with the
knowledge and tools to champion for DRR and climate resilience in their communities.
Based on a 'train-the-trainer' model, the course covered climate science, types of disasters,
vulnerabilities, and response mechanisms, complemented by hands-on sessions in first aid and
real-time monitoring systems. It empowered the participants to foster social responsibility,
raise awareness, and mobilize grassroots action for a sustainable and resilient future. The
course covered topics like the national and state-level plans and policies, including the State
Disaster Management Plan, Climate Change Action Plans, and the Prime Minister’s Ten-Point
Agenda for DRR.
A total of 27 participants enrolled in the four-day course, including school teachers, college
students, and research scholars from Kerala and Tamil Nadu, reflecting a diverse
representation. The course incorporated both pre- and post-evaluations to assess participants’
knowledge before and after the sessions. Feedback was also collected to evaluate the
effectiveness of the current curriculum, identify areas for improvement, and inform the design
of the next level of the certificate course.</p>
</div>
<div class="course-card">
<h3>Resilient Futures: Navigating Climate Risks</h3>
<p>An executive program focused on climate risk governance and reporting standards.</p>
<p>The two-day executive education program equipped industry leaders, policymakers, and
sustainability professionals with practical knowledge and tools to understand, assess, and
manage climate risks while developing future-ready, climate resilient and sustainable business
strategies. A total of 12 participants attended the course out of the 15 available seats.
The course began with an inaugural address by Prof. Nava Subramanyam, Dean, School of
Business, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Ettimadai Campus and Air Commodore- Satheesh
Menon, Campus Director, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Ettimadai. This was followed by a
pre-evaluation to map the participants’ baseline understanding. The pre-evaluation sheet
indicated notable gaps in their knowledge of key components of the curriculum, particularly
global frameworks, reporting frameworks such as TCFD, ISSB, and BRSR, as well as scenario
analysis, risk assessment, and the linkage between financial materiality and environmental risk.
The sessions began with an overview of climate change and its impacts on industries, providing
insights into physical and transition risks, and highlighting the role of circularity, efficiency, and
green supply chains in driving business value. Participants also examined a real-world case study
on PG&amp;E to understand the financial and operational consequences of climate-related risks. A
session was also held on climate risk analysis frameworks, along with a detailed discussion on
risk indicators and metrics.
Day 2 focused on hands-on training on use of tools and frameworks, particularly those
outlined in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), for conducting climate risk assessments
under various emissions scenarios (SSP/RCP pathways). Participants were trained to map
industrial exposure to climate hazards and evaluate the impacts of climate shocks on different
sectors. The session also included a demonstration of a sample risk evaluation, illustrating a
step-by-step methodology using a real-world problem. Additional sessions emphasized the
development of a sustainability-oriented leadership mindset, strategies for building
climate-resilient infrastructure and processes, and approaches to integrating climate risk
management into corporate strategy. The course finally provided an overview of climate finance
mechanisms, global taxonomies, the NGFS framework, and emerging disclosure standards such
as CSRD, SFDR, and PCAF.
The session was followed by a post-evaluation, which showed satisfactory improvement
in addressing the participants’ knowledge gaps. During the feedback session, participants
suggested offering similar courses tailored to industry-specific needs particularly those related to
community and livelihood sectors to support organisations such as microfinance institutions in
developing risk plans. They also requested a longer course with additional time for tools and
hands-on practice, as well as an extended discussion session beyond the scheduled program.
The program concluded with the distribution of certificates to the participants by Tapasyamrita
Swamiji.</p>

<h3>Amrita Dynamic Regional Landslide Risk Management Platform</h3>
<div class="project-meta">
<strong>Status:</strong> Launched for Pilot Implementation<br/>
<strong>Location:</strong> Kodagu District, Karnataka<br/>
<strong>Operational Partner:</strong> Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC)
            </div>
<p>
<strong>Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham</strong> has launched the
                <strong>Amrita Dynamic Regional Landslide Risk Management Platform (Amrita Kripa)</strong>,
                an integrated, real-time decision-support system aimed at strengthening landslide monitoring,
                preparedness, and emergency response.
            </p>
<p>
                The platform has been rolled out in <strong>Kodagu District, Karnataka</strong> as a
                <strong>pilot deployment</strong> and shared with <strong>KSNDMC</strong> for operational testing.
                It integrates landslide susceptibility mapping, village-level social vulnerability and exposure,
                and real-time as well as antecedent rainfall threshold monitoring to deliver
                <strong>hourly updated landslide risk assessments</strong> and planning support through an operational dashboard.
